        <h2>What is CaaS?</h2>
       
        <p>Communications as a service (CaaS) is a collection of different vendor services that facilitate business communications. Organizations may use these and similar services to lower costs and increase efficiency for business processes involving audio or video telecommunications</p>
         <p>The core concept of CaaS is that accessing these services over the internet is extremely convenient. The client businesses do not have to worry about maintaining servers and connections, uploading different kinds of content or doing all of the administrative work involved in keeping a communications platform functional. Business users just sign in and use the services. Types of CaaS include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or internet telephone solutions, and video conferencing services.</p>
         <p>CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.</p>
