         <h2 class="heading">Uses of Cloud Computing </h2>
        <p> You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realise it. If you use an online service to send email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible behind the scenes. The first cloud computing services are barely a decade old, but already a variety of organisations—from tiny startups to global corporations, government agencies to non-profits—are embracing the technology for all sorts of reasons. Here are a few of the things you can do with the cloud:</p>
         <br/>
        <p>&bull; Create new apps and services</p>
         <p>&bull; Store, back up and recover data</p>
          <p>&bull; Host websites and blogs</p>
           <p>&bull; Stream audio and video</p>
            <p>&bull; Deliver software on demand</p>
            <p>&bull; Analyse data for patterns and make predictions</p>
            </br>
            </br>
            <h2 class="heading">Top benefits of cloud computing</h2>
            <p>Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. What is it about cloud computing? Why is cloud computing so popular Here are 3 common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services:</p>
            </br>
            <h3 class="heading">1. Cost</h3>
            <p>Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.</p>
            </br>
            <h3 class="heading">2. Speed</h3>
            <p>Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.</p>
            </br>
            <h3 class="heading">3. Global Scale</h3>
            <p>The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when its needed and from the right geographic location.</p>
